                    <li>Born on January 1942</li>
                    <li>Hawking began his university education at University College, Oxford, in October 1959 at the age of 17.</li>
                    <li>He joined the University College Boat Club, where he coxed a rowing-crew.</li>
                    <li> After receiving a first-class BA degree in physics, he began his graduate work at Trinity Hall, Cambridge, in October 1962.</li>
                    <li>After being diagnosed with motor neurone disease, Hawking fell into a depression.</li>
                    <li>He obtained his PhD degree in applied mathematics and theoretical physics, in March 1966</li>
                    <li>In 1970, Hawking postulated what became known as the second law of black hole dynamics, that the event horizon of a black hole can never get smaller.</li>
                    <li>Beginning in 1973, Hawking moved into the study of quantum gravity and quantum mechanics.</li>
                    <li>His results showed that black holes emit radiation, known today as Hawking radiation</li>
                </ul>
